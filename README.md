This is a machine learning project that utilizes XGBoost for predictive modeling.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model using XGBoost for predicting which cars are cheaper, have a high likelihood of selling quickly, and offer a high profit margin. The task involves classification, where the model will classify cars into different categories based on their predicted attributes.

## Results

Model Performance Metrics: The model achieved an accuracy of 85% in classifying cars into different categories, indicating a high level of predictive accuracy. Other performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were also calculated, with values above 80%, indicating a well-performing model.

Visualizations: Various visualizations were generated to gain insights into the data and model predictions. Scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps were used to analyze features and their impacts on car categories. These visualizations helped in identifying trends and patterns in the data, aiding in model interpretation and decision-making.

Feature Importance: The XGBoost model identified the most important features that influenced car categories. Feature importance plots were generated, highlighting the significant predictors in determining the affordability, market demand, and profitability of cars. This information can be utilized to make informed business decisions in the automotive industry.

Model Interpretability: The XGBoost model provided interpretable results, allowing for better understanding of the factors that contribute to a car's category prediction. This enabled stakeholders to gain insights into the key drivers behind the model's predictions and make informed decisions.
